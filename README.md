# The_Peg_Game_Solver
This code finds all possible solutions of the "Peg Game" and displays the solution selected by a user! 
It takes ~ 1 minite for the solver to find all 29760 possible solutions.
Then it removes all solutions which are permutations of the other solutions, giving just 64 unique solutions.
You have to select one of the 64 solutions to display its animation.
If you are getting error while running the cell to display the solution, try to run it twice (it's a bug in the turtle library).
